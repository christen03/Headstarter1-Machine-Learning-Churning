## Headstarter Project 1 - Machine Learning Churning:

Much more to come when I get some time to come back to this, but for now, I trained a few machine learning models off a data set from kaggle and used them to predict the probability that a customer would churn.
Through the web app, we are able to choose between different customers from the dataset and edit filters and models, allowing users to see different combinations of values that would cause a customer to churn.
In addition, a Llama 3.1 model provides a brief explanation as to why they think the customer will churn or will not churn as well as provides a basic email to be sent to the customer to incentivize them to stay with the bank.

Video rundown:


## ML MODELS ##
ML models are all files that end in `.pkl`

## WEB APP ##
The actual web app, made in replit using streamlit, are files ending in `.py`

## MODEL TRAINING ##
The `churn.csv` file was used to train the models. The model training notebook is `HeadstarterProj1.ipynb`

## DEMO VIDEO ##
